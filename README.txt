This is a ArmA 3 COOP mission for up to 20 players, NATO version.

The short version is, it's a dominiation like mission. But actually it doesn't have 
too much in common with domination. The AOs are handpicked and there are different 
mission types (like the sidemissions).

The server randomly picks a mission (5) and a location (15) and waits until you finish
the mission. After two minutes you'll get the next mission until there are no missions
left.

The idea for this mission came from an A2 mission called Takistan Force by Bon_Inf*. 
I dissected and tweaked his A2 version for about 2 years just for me and a friend 
and now with A3 I thought I have to give something back to this awesome community.

Thanks to the respective authors of all the awesome scripts/mods I'm using in this mission:
